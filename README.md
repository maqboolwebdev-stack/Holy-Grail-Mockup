## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete page layout built entirely with CSS Grid.  
The grid structure is used to organize all major sections of the page, including:

- **Header with navigation links**  
- **Sidebar content**  
- **Main navigation area**  
- **Primary content section**

By relying on CSS Grid, the layout stays clean, responsive, and easy to manage.
